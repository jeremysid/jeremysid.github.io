			<h4>Happy 5/6th Monthsary, Thea.
You are the prettiest girl, the cutest, and the most perfect girlfriend; You are always enough, I could never consider loving any other girl that's how much you have influenced me, Thank You for always being here with me I could never express how much I appreaciate you even though sometimes I do mess up and upset you.
These past few months have been the most joy and confusion I have ever been through, the latter is the cause of me being oblivious to my own and other's feelings.
I want us to grow old together although that might be a little foolish given that we are still young developing into the best version of ourselves, If we grow out of love for each other please remember my suggestions.
You are my reason for further improving myself to understand others better, to learn how to love and treat another person properly.
I've thought of leaving a lot of times, but leaving you would only hurt us both, I will hold on to you and to us even after we grow out of love.
I love you until all of the atoms in the universe blows up, until all of recognized thoughts seem to mix together into a void of nothingness, until all of my cells have deteriorated, and finally until I stop comprehending my own thoughts.</h4>
