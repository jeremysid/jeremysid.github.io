        Happy 8th Monthsarry my Lover!

        You will always be the one for me, you are the prettiest, cutest, and the most beautiful girl that I have and ever will love.
        Thank you for putting up with me even on my bad/moody days, even when I don't watch my words and end up saying bad things to you.
        Thank you so much for loving and caring for me, these 8 months have been the best I've ever been in a lot of areas, namely I learned how to be more appreciative, considerate, and most importantly how to love someone with everything that I've got; I'm a lot happier when I talk to you, my depressive thoughts vanished when I started to love you, I improved a lot thanks to you: you are my reason for being, my motivation and aspiration, with you life just gets better, my hobbies (calisthenics, manga, anime, tech, and books) have been much more fulfilling knowing that I get to share my good and bad experiences with you, I improved from my bad habits because I want to be a better person not just for me but also for you and our relationship.
        
        I love how you make me feel loved, cared, and adored; To me you are the best girlfriend, I never thought that I could ever care and love another person the way I love you, my trust for you is great you don't make me overthink or doubt you or our relationship.
        I could never find a way to show how much I appreciate and love you, the best so far has been with my updates, efforts, and this website. I want to remind you that bas days, arguments, or you being cold to me is nothing I'll love you nevertheless, I'll improve myself ever more to be the best possible person and lover to you; The thought of ending or a "cool off" to our relationship will never cross my mind; I plan on marrying you and growing old together so thinking about those things is just out of the question for me. I wish I could spoil you with all I've got until that happens I'll spoil you with I love you's and kisses (may at walang tunog).
        
        P.S:
        I'll love until the universe turns to dust, I'll love you until my hearts stops beating, I'll love you until life itself fades.
        I love you so much, I love you more than one could imagine was possible.
