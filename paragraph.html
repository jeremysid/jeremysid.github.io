			<h4>Happy Monthsarry Thea, my lover.
I love you from the bottom of my heart,
words alone can't express how much I love you your personality, your sweetness, your cuteness, your overall self that I've fallen for,
my expressions might be a little numb.
although sometimes I get a little grumpy with you, I want you know that I still love you my affection and my love for you will never fade, even in a million years.
if we ever break up(which will never happen, guarenteed) know that I will never get over you, you are perfect, I wish I could express it better.
saying that i love you is all that I can do for now to show my affection, maybe in due time I'll have another way of showing how much affection that I have for you.
As I've read in a qoute before
"loving someone isn't a one time event or feeling, it lingers until death".
ps: I hope that this was enough even though it's a little short.
ps2: I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you, there isn't a time where i don't love you.</h4>
