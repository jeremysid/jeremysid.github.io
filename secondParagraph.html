			<h4>Happy Monthsarry Thea, my soulmate, my lover.
It's been a month and I may have found some words that could explain my feelings for you and us, you are my lover(as I've said); my reason for being,
for improving myself, for actually trying to be a better person not just for you but for me too. You are the best thing that's ever happened in my life, like really besides like me being alive. You are also the best girlfriend/lover that I will ever have ( I plan to make you my last), besides my previous reasons you always make me feel accepted, understood, and I no longer feel lonely.
My affection for you will last longer than a universes lifetime, that is guaranteed by me. I love you everyday, this might seem corny/cheesy but I'll never stop loving you, your whole being, the person you are. There is a qoute that I have seen "In my heart I love her all the time", I think it is a very relatable qoute, because I do love you all the time even when sometimes I'm a bit rude or mean to you. You are still the reason why death is such an unbearable thought, why I don't want it to catch me yet.
p.s: I love you a lot and I always will, until my last thought.</h4>
